### What I Learned

While developing the SQL Employee Tracker project, I gained practical experience in database management and SQL operations. I learned how to create and manipulate MySQL databases, including creating tables and establishing relationships between them. I also enhanced my skills in writing complex SQL queries for data insertion, updating, deletion, and retrieval. Additionally, I developed proficiency in integrating SQL databases with Node.js applications using mysql2 and inquirer packages, improving my backend development skills. This project likely also honed my problem-solving abilities, as I navigated various challenges and debugged issues in my code.

## Usage

The SQL Employee Tracker is a command-line application designed to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Here's how it is used:

1. **Starting the Application**:

- Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a main menu presented through the command-line interface. This is facilitated by the `cfonts` library for an enhanced visual appeal.

2. **Navigating Options**:

- The main menu, powered by `Inquirer.js`, presents various options including viewing departments, roles, and employees; adding departments, roles, and employees; updating employee roles; assigning managers; and deleting departments, roles, or employees.

3. **Viewing Data**:

- Users can view lists of all departments, roles, and employees. These lists are displayed in a table format for easy reading.

4. **Adding Data**:

- New departments, roles, and employees can be added to the database. Users input details like department names, role titles and salaries, and employee names and roles through a series of prompts.

5. **Updating Data**:

- The application allows updating existing employee roles and assigning managers to employees. This is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date record as company structures change.

6. **Deleting Data**:

- Users have the option to delete departments, roles, or employees from the database, catering to the dynamic nature of employee management.

7. **Budget Analysis**:

- A unique feature is viewing the total utilized budget of a department, which calculates the combined salaries of all employees in a department.

8. **Exiting the Application**:

- The application can be exited at any time by choosing the "Exit" option, which safely closes the database connection.

This application is particularly useful for HR departments, team leads, or managers who need an efficient way to track and manage employee information, roles, and departments within an organization. Its command-line interface makes it accessible without the need for a graphical user interface, streamlining the data management process.
